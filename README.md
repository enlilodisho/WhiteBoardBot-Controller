# Whiteboard Bot

The Whiteboard Bot is a robot that allows you to draw something on an Android phone or tablet and then it recreates the drawing onto a whiteboard. The project was created in a team of 4 for the Spring 2019 IEEE Quarterly Projects at the University of California - San Diego (UCSD).

_The code in this repository is what I worked on in the team. It is for the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller that controls the robot. It does not include the code for the Android app._
